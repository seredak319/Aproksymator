# Approximator
An application used to approximate graphs based on given points.
The approximation is done through several implemented methods such as, approximation based on 4th degree polynomials, approximation based on splines and linear approximation.

$:./make --> approximation based on 4th degree polynomials

$:./make aprox --> approximation based on splines

$:./make prosta --> linear approximation
